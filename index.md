# MATH 545 Applied Linear Algebra

## Description

Math 545 is an advanced linear algebra course that builds on the concepts and
techniques introduced in Math 235 (Intro Linear Algebra). We will study the
decomposition of matrices, particularly the LU, QR, Cholesky and SVD
decompositions. The coursework will be a mix of proof and computation. We will
also study vector spaces and linear transformations, inner product spaces,
orthogonality, spectral theory, and Jordan form. We will emphasize applications
of these techniques to various problems including solutions of linear systems,
least-square fitting, fast Fourier transforms, dynamical systems. The final part
covers algorithms for computation of eigenpairs, iterative methods for linear
systems, etc.


## Learning Goals

* Summarize properties and constructions of matrix decompositions LU, QR, Cholesky and SVD
* Perform matrix computations using mathematical software Python, SciPy and Jupyter
* Compute solutions of linear systems of equations using matrix decompositions
* Compute least squares approximations of linear systems of equations using matrix decompositions
* Eigenvalues of matrices.
* The Fourier transform.
* Iterative methods for linear systems and eigenpairs.
